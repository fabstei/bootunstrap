#Bootunstrap

Information:
---------------------

Bootstrap based project that keeps Bootstrap as a separate submodule



Dependancies:
---------------------

You'll need to have [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and  [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) installed along with the following Node Packages:

[Recess](https://github.com/twitter/recess) - A simple and attractive code quality tool for CSS built on top of LESS

[UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS) - JavaScript parser / mangler / compressor / beautifier library for NodeJS

[ShellJS](https://github.com/arturadib/shelljs) - Portable Unix shell commands for Node.js

    $ sudo npm install recess uglify-js shelljs -g

*The build script that currently does all the build magic is written as a shell script so it may only work in *NIX sytems (should work with cygwin but haven't fully tested this.)



QUICK-START
---------------------

Checkout the Bootunstrap project and build

    $ git clone https://github.com/inkidotcom/bootunstrap.git bootunstrap
    $ cd bootunstrap
    $ git submodule update --recursive
    $ ./build.sh bootstrap

open index.html in your browser



Build Script
---------------------

You can run the build script without any options and you will be presented with the currently available options **clean**, **bootstrap**, **update** or **quit**

    $ ./build.sh

Or, you can run a command directly by passing it as an argument

    $ ./build.sh bootstrap

### Commands:

clean
: removes local Bootstrap files (css/bootstrap, img/bootstrap, js/bootstrap)

    $ ./build.sh clean

bootstrap
: compiles Bootstrap css and js and copies over Bootstrap img assets

    $ ./build.sh bootstrap

update <branch>
: updates Bootstrap to master or branch as specified by second parameter

    $ ./build.sh update
    $ ./build.sh update 2.2.2-wip
